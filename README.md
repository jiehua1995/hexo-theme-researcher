Before using the theme, you need to create the following pages:

```bash
hexo new page publications
hexo new page projects
hexo new page talks
hexo new page cv
hexo new page contact
```

After creating each page, you need to set the correct layout in the front-matter of each page's markdown file. For example, for the publications page:

```yaml
---
title: Publications
date: 2024-01-01
layout: publications
---
```

Similarly, set the layout for other pages to match their names (e.g., `layout: projects` for projects page, `layout: talks` for talks page, etc.).

## Data Files

- `publications.yml`: Your academic publications
- `projects.yml`: Research projects
- `talks.yml`: Presentations and talks
- `cv.yml`: Your CV/resume information
