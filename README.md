- npm or yarn package manager

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Hexo CLI globally:**
```bash
npm install -g hexo-cli
```

2. **Create a new Hexo site:**
```bash
hexo init my-academic-site
cd my-academic-site
```

3. **Install required Hexo packages:**
```bash
yarn install
```

4. **Install theme dependencies (required for search functionality):**
```bash
yarn add hexo-generator-search --save
```

5. **Clone the theme:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jiehua1995/hexo-theme-researcher themes/hexo-theme-researcher
```

6. **Configure your main site** by editing `_config.yml` in your site's root directory:
```yaml
# Site Information
title: Your Name
subtitle: Your Academic Title
description: Your research description and academic bio
keywords: research, academic, portfolio, your-field
author: Your Name
language: en
timezone: ''

# URL Configuration
url: https://yourusername.github.io
root: /
permalink: :year/:month/:day/:title/
permalink_defaults:
  lang: en

# Theme Configuration
theme: hexo-theme-researcher

# Search Configuration (Required for search functionality)
search:
  path: search.xml
  field: post
  content: true

# Deployment (example for GitHub Pages)
deploy:
  type: git
  repo: https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
  branch: main
```

7. **Create the required pages** that the theme uses to display your academic content.

Before using the theme, you need to create the following pages in your Hexo site:

```bash
# Create all required pages
hexo new page publications
hexo new page projects
hexo new page talks
hexo new page cv
hexo new page notes
hexo new page contact
```

After creating each page, you **must** set the correct layout in the front-matter of each page's markdown file:

**Publications page** (`source/publications/index.md`):
```yaml
---
title: Publications
date: 2024-01-01
layout: publications
---
```

**Projects page** (`source/projects/index.md`):
```yaml
---
title: Projects
date: 2024-01-01
layout: projects
---
```

**CV page** (`source/cv/index.md`):
```yaml
---
title: CV
date: 2024-01-01
layout: cv
---
```

**Talks page** (`source/talks/index.md`):
```yaml
---
title: Talks
date: 2024-01-01
layout: talks
---
```

**Notes page** (`source/notes/index.md`):
```yaml
---
title: Notes
date: 2024-01-01
layout: notes
---
```

**Contact page** (`source/contact/index.md`):
```yaml
---
title: Contact
date: 2024-01-01
layout: contact
---
```

**Important Notes**

- The `layout` field must match the page name exactly
- The Notes page will automatically display all your blog posts
- The Recent Notes section on the homepage will show the 3 latest posts automatically

Edit `_config.yml` in the theme directory to customize your site:

8. **Configure the theme** by editing the `_config.yml` file located in the `themes/hexo-theme-researcher` directory. Edit `_config.yml` in the theme directory to customize your site.

   It will be better to copy the `_config.yml` out as `_config.hexo-theme-researcher.yml ` into the main folder.

```bash
cp themes/hexo-theme-researcher/_config.yml _config.hexo-theme-researcher.yml
```

9. **Create blog posts** by adding markdown files in the `source/_posts` directory.
To create blog posts, use the standard Hexo command:
```bash
hexo new post "Your Post Title"
```

‚Äã	Then you could write whatever you want, those notes will be shown in **Notes** page.

9. **Create data files** in the `source/_data` directory to manage your academic content.

   Create the following data files in your site's `source/_data` directory. You can find example data in the theme's `demo_data` folder:

- `publications.yml`: Your academic publications
- `projects.yml`: Research projects
- `talks.yml`: Presentations and talks
- `cv.yml`: Your CV/resume information
